# Amazon Clone 

## An E-Commerce App in Nextjs

This application was created with the most popular React framework Nextjs. It includes a list of items generated by a Fake Store API and displayed with a responsive layout thanks to Tailwind CSS. Items can be added to the basket thanks Redux managing the state within the project itself.  Authentication is handled by library NextAuth and allows users to login using either their Google account or their GitHub account. Users can also purchase the items in their basket using Stripe's checkout feature. However, since this is a demo, no actual money transactions will occur. This full-stack application also utilizes webhooks to update user's checkout information and store the information about the items purchased from the firebase cloudstorage.

## Purpose of this Project 

I wanted to build something that would help me understand how to use Redux and Authentication. I've never utilized other providers to login users to my application before this project. I would like to thank Sonny Sangha for this project. To add onto this project, I added Github as a provider.
